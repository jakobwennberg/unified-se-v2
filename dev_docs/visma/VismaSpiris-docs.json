This means your main service could be having downtime, but as long as your queue endpoint is responding, you'll have all your notifications on your end. If you don't respond after all our retries, the webhook will be inactivated automatically.

If you don't reply to our notification requests with a status code in the 200-299 range, we'll interpret that as a failed request. We will try to send the notification again, incrementing the RetryAttempt property once. We will make five attempts on each notification before deleting it. Each attempt will be delayed according to this schedule:\n\nTable:\nRetry Attempt | Delay Added In Seconds | Information\n1 | 1\n2 | 17\n3 | 300\n4 | 5000\n5 | 86400 | Notification will be deleted after this attempt and webhook will be disabled.\n\nRetry Attempt\n\nDelay Added In Seconds\n\nInformation\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n17\n\n3\n\n300\n\n4\n\n5000\n\n5\n\n86400\n\nNotification will be deleted after this attempt and webhook will be disabled.\n\nThe best way to make sure you don't lose any notifications is to store them in a local queue directly, reply to us with a successful statuscode, then have code listening to the queue and act accordingly.
